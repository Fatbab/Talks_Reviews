Often times predicting viral conent before they become viral is advantagous to organizations and companies. Everyday, over 500 million posts are published on Twitter and over 4.5 billion piece of content is shared via Facebook. In addition to the vast amount of data, Twitter and Facebook support free API's that enables access to these (anonymised) content. 

While access to data is provided, we need mathematical modeling tools to help us derive information from this data: Sigmoid function.    
Any virus, experiences growth that can be described by a sigmoid:
